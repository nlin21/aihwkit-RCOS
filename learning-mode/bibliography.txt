But what is a neural network? | Chapter 1, Deep learning, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown
- This video is a general introduction to the idea of neural networks. It covers nodes, layers, and the connections between them. The
video also touches on weights, biases, and the underlying math behind training a neural network.

Gradient descent, how neural networks learn | Chapter 2, Deep learning, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w&t=1118s&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown
- This video goes in detail about the process(es) in training a neural network. It describes in depth how cost functions are calculated
and how they are written notation-wise. Most importantly, this video explains how cost functions are minimized using the process of 
gradient descent.

What is backpropagation really doing? | Chapter 3, Deep learning, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown
- This video explains how gradient descent (stochastic gradient descent) is used to determine weights and biases through 
a process called backpropagation.

Backpropagation calculus | Chapter 4, Deep learning, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIeHLnjs5U8&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown
- This video is mainly about the math behind the backpropagation process. This includes the chain rule in neural networks, 
derivative computations, and more calculus.
