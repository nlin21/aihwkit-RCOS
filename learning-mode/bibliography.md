## But what is a neural network? | Chapter 1, Deep learning 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown
- This video is a general introduction to the idea of neural networks. 
- It covers nodes, layers, and the connections between them. 
- The video also covers weights, biases, and the underlying math behind training a neural network.<br><br>

## Gradient descent, how neural networks learn | Chapter 2, Deep learning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w&t=1118s&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown
- This video goes in detail about the process(es) in training a neural network.
- It describes in depth how cost functions are calculated and how they are written notation-wise.
- Most importantly, this video explains how cost functions are minimized using the process of gradient descent.<br><br>

## What is backpropagation really doing? | Chapter 3, Deep learning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown
- This video explains how gradient descent (stochastic gradient descent) is used to determine weights and biases through a process called backpropagation.<br><br>

## Backpropagation calculus | Chapter 4, Deep learning, 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIeHLnjs5U8&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown
- This video is mainly about the math behind the backpropagation process. 
- This includes the chain rule in neural networks, derivative computations, and more calculus.<br><br>
